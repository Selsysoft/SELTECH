# SELTECH (ANDROID STUDIO & ARDUINO UNO)
Mobil controlled greenhouse system...

A lot of software, etc. made to make our lives easier on mobile devices, which are more and more in our lives every day. There are transactions. My project is to design a mobile controlled greenhouse system with robotic coding in the ardoino by providing control from a mobile application with a bluetooth module. To be able to control the operations to be done easily and easily by transferring data from the mobile application to Arduino. The operations performed are to perform Irrigation, Ventilation, Lighting, Heating and Security operations and to follow the humidity and temperature values ​​instantly and to choose the processes accordingly.
